* Hopper Puzzle Data

Hopper has this intereting dataset that does not have any description on it.
After playing around with it, it is atually coordinates. Considering hopper is a
tech company that help its customers find the cheapest flights possible, I think
these are the airports locations in the world.

However, There are only far fewer datapoints that fall in China comparing with
Europe and US, which makes me thinking that these datapoints actually represent
Hopper's globlal network.
